There are thousands of movies available today. This project searches a movie database for an overview of a movie specified by the user and outputs the result accordingly.

REST API created by themoviedb.org is used to retrieve the movie overview. The JSON formatted information is retrieved via the cURL library in PHP. A combination of Javascript and AJAX was used to develop the movie search and result fields. This allows for quick search results as no page reloading is needed. Bootstrap was used to easily create a column style layout in addition to creating the search and overview fields.
